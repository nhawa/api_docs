        "description": "Purchase a pampering at two fabulous spas specializing in various massage, skin, and hair treatments Visit the home of a female Balinese Hindu priest for a spiritual healing and meditation ceremony Sip a sunset cocktail at one of the best beach bars in Southeast Asia Cruise around Bali in a retro-cool 80s VW van kitted out with a mini-bar, 10-speaker sound system, and wifi! <br /><br />\n Bali is practically synonymous with pampering, and thatâs what weâre giving you on this cultural spa tour! Youâll cleanse your consciousness with a visit to a Balinese mangku, beautify your body with a luxury spa treatment, and sip cocktails at sunset at a fabulous beach bar. Talk about the ultimate mind-body treatment! Your Bali tour will take you southeast from Ku De Ta Seminyak to Legian, where youâll arrive at one of the islandâs best spas. Youâll get to pick from a list of treatments (at your own cost), anything from a Shiwa Balinese massage to a Balinese Boreh body mask, with 60 to 90 minutes specifically set aside for you to relax and enjoy! <br /><br />\nSpa treatments have long been practiced locally on the island, and today, Bali is a world-leader in such indulgences â so youâre in the right place for pampering! Then, with your mind mellow and your body blissed-out, weâll stop for a 3-course lunch at the spa cafÃ©, where you can fill up on delicious dishes like Sumatran-style beef or snapper cooked in white wine. After lunch, weâll head to the home of a local mangku (priest) for a spiritual healing and meditation session. Ibu Mangku practices the ancient art of spiritual healing and meditation, and sheâll lead you through a private ceremony to help unlock your unconscious. Whatâs more, female priests are quite rare in Bali, so a meeting with her will be an extra special experience! This ceremony can be quite emotional for some people â itâs not uncommon for some participants to cry during the process. <br /><br />\n However, the mangku will care for all participants and explain to those affected how they can continue their healing after theyâve left her home and temple. Weâll then depart the mangkuâs house and travel back into Seminyak for stops at two spas: a popular womenâs spot for hair treatments and mani-pedis, and a menâs barber for cutthroat shaves, hair treatments, and athletic massages. Pick you treatment preference (at your own cost) and indulge! With everyone pampered, blessed, and relaxed, weâll head to one of the best bars in Southeast Asia for a sunset cocktail (or two â trust us, you wonât be in a rush to leave!). Lastly, throughout it all, youâll be travelling in retro-cool style, in a modified 1980s VW Kombi limo equipped with a sound system, 2,000 tunes to choose from, a mini bar, and wifi and charging ports and cables (so that you can upload all those jealousy-inducing Instagrams, of course!).\n\\n<br /><br />\n<strong>Duration:</strong> 7.5 hours <br />\n<strong>Start/opening time:</strong>10am. <br />\n<strong>Languages:</strong> English<br />\n<strong>Others:</strong> Adult above 15 years old only\n\\n",
